# Build the application JAR
# This layer only changes if your source code changes
RUN ./mvnw package -DskipTests

# STAGE 2: The "Extractor" Stage
# - Extracts the layers from the JAR file created by the builder.
# ===================================================================================

# STAGE 3: The Final Image
# - Uses a minimal Java Runtime Environment (JRE), not a full JDK.
